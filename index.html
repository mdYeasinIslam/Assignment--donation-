            <P> About 26,000 sq km (18%) of Bangladesh is flooded by monsoons every year. At this time, especially in
                the northern part of the country, the Banavasi people are the victims of extreme misery. The As-Sunnah
                Foundation conducts relief activities every year in the flood-hit districts of the country and takes the
                initiative to stand by the needy and helpless people.
